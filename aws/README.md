## Prerequisites

- **AWS CLI** installed and authenticated (e.g., `aws configure`)
- **Terraform** installed (1.4+)
- **jq** installed for JSON parsing ([Download jq](https://jqlang.org/download/))
- **AWS credentials** available to Terraform/CLI (env vars or shared config)

---

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd aws/scripts
   ```

2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

The setup script will display SSH connection instructions when complete.

**Cost**: ~$0.50-1.00/session. Destroy when done.

---

## How This Lab Works

This lab has **two separate activities**:

- **Diagnose via SSH** — The setup script gives you an SSH command to connect through the bastion host. Use it to hop into VMs and check what's broken (test connectivity, resolve DNS, curl endpoints, etc.).
- **Fix via AWS CLI** — Once you know the root cause, open a separate terminal on your **local machine** and fix the misconfigured cloud resources using `aws` commands (e.g., fix security groups, route tables, DNS records).

Do **not** edit Terraform files to fix issues. Do **not** try to fix things from inside the VMs. The cloud infrastructure is what's broken — fix it with the cloud CLI.

After fixing, run `./validate.sh` to confirm.

---

## Getting Help

If you run into issues (broken instructions, validation failures you can’t explain, or suspected bugs), please open a **GitHub Issue** in this repo:

- [Open an issue](../issues/new/choose)
- Include: incident ID (e.g., INC-4521), what you tried, and `./validate.sh` output (redact secrets/tokens).

## Incident Queue

You're on call. Four tickets just came in. Your job: diagnose and fix.

### 🎫 INC-4521: API service can't pull external data

**Priority:** High  
**Reported by:** Backend Team  
**Time:** 09:47 AM

> "Our API service that runs on the private subnet stopped being able to fetch data from external APIs this morning. We didn't change anything on our end. Requests to third-party services just hang and timeout. Internal calls between our services still work fine."

**Affected system:** API server (private subnet)

---

### 🎫 INC-4522: Service discovery broken

**Priority:** High  
**Reported by:** Platform Team  
**Time:** 10:15 AM

> "Our applications can't resolve internal hostnames anymore. We've been using `web.internal.local`, `api.internal.local`, and `db.internal.local` for service discovery but they stopped resolving. Public DNS works fine - we can resolve google.com. This is blocking deployments."

**Affected system:** All VMs

---

### 🎫 INC-4523: Web frontend can't reach backend

**Priority:** Critical  
**Reported by:** Web Team  
**Time:** 10:32 AM

> "The web frontend suddenly can't connect to the API backend. We're getting connection refused errors on port 8080. The API health endpoint works when we curl localhost on the API server itself, so the service is running. Also, the API team says they can't reach the database on port 5432."

**Affected systems:** Web server → API server, API server → Database

---

### 🎫 INC-4524: Security audit findings

**Priority:** Medium  
**Reported by:** Security Team  
**Time:** 11:00 AM

> "Our quarterly security scan flagged several issues with the network segmentation:
> 
> 1. SSH is accessible from the internet on all hosts — bastion should only allow SSH from your trusted source IP/CIDR, and internal hosts (web, API, database) should only allow SSH from the bastion security group
> 2. Database accepts connections on port 5432 from too broad a range — it should only accept connections from the API security group
> 3. ICMP is open from anywhere on the web server — it should only be allowed from the bastion security group
> 
> These need to be tightened up before our compliance review next week."

**Affected systems:** Security groups / NACLs

---

## Verify Your Fixes

The validation script tests actual connectivity—not just configuration. It SSHs into the VMs and runs the same checks a user would to confirm services are reachable. Sometimes, you may need to wait a minute or two for changes to propogate before validating.

**When to use it:**
- After fixing an incident to confirm it's resolved
- When you think you're done with all incidents
- To generate a completion token for submission

**Check incident status:**

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd aws/scripts
   ```

2. Run validation:
   ```bash
   ./validate.sh
   ```

**Generate completion token:**

1. Run export:
   ```bash
   ./validate.sh export
   ```

2. Enter your GitHub username when prompted

## Troubleshooting

### `terraform destroy` fails with errors

If `./destroy.sh` exits with errors, it is most likely because you created cloud resources while resolving the incidents that are not tracked by Terraform. Terraform cannot delete resources it does not manage, and some AWS resources cannot be deleted while dependent resources still exist.

Read the error message carefully — it will name the resource that is blocking deletion. Delete that resource manually with the AWS CLI, then run `./destroy.sh` again.

## Clean Up

When finished, destroy resources to avoid charges:

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd aws/scripts
   ```

2. Run the destroy script:
   ```bash
   ./destroy.sh
   ```

> **Note:** If `terraform destroy` fails, it's likely because you created resources via the AWS CLI (e.g., security group rules, route table entries) that Terraform doesn't know about. Delete those resources manually with `aws` first, then re-run `./destroy.sh`.
